**Abstract:** Getting information about other people's opinions is an important part of the purchase decision process. Therefore, consumers publish and obtain information about products in collaborative reviews sites. However, such sites have a huge amount of data that can hinder the user to get a useful product review. This article analyzes textual aspects of reviews, in terms of readability, to identify factors that can be used as indicators of their helpfulness. Considering the set of indicators used in the literature, our experiments show 16 other relevant aspects that can be applied in the automatic assessment of online review helpfulness.

**Keywords:** readability, reviews, helpfulness.
